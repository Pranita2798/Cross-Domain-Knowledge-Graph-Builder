## üîß Advanced Configuration

### **Customizing Entity Extraction**

The system uses pattern-based extraction that can be customized in `src/utils/textProcessor.ts`:

```typescript
// Add new entity patterns
private static entityPatterns = {
  person: /\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b/g,
  organization: /\bUniversity|Corp|Inc|Ltd\b/gi,
  // Add your custom patterns here
};
```

### **Adding New Relationship Types**

Extend relationship detection by modifying the patterns:

```typescript
private static relationshipPatterns = [
  { pattern: /(\w+)\s+founded\s+(\w+)/g, type: 'founded' },
  // Add new relationship patterns
];
```

### **Customizing Visualization**

Modify graph appearance in `src/components/GraphVisualization.tsx`:

```typescript
// Customize node colors
const getNodeColor = (type: Entity['type']): string => {
  const colors = {
    person: '#FF6B6B',
    organization: '#4ECDC4',
    // Add custom colors
  };
  return colors[type] || '#DDA0DD';
};
```
